                <section>
                    <p>&emsp;To a young, creative mind, the tech industry presents a cryptic, 
                        dull, gray, wasteland filled with computers and code. That’s what 
                        I used to think as a young girl who had never touched a single line 
                        of code in my life. My first interactions with any kind of code involved 
                        HTML and a little CSS for one of my web development classes in high school, 
                        which was somewhat exciting, but I never realized what considerable projects
                         those simple lines of code could be capable of creating. It wasn’t until my 
                         first project in one of my college freshman Computer Science classes that I 
                         truly gained the desire for coding and everything it provided.
        
                        <br>
                        <br>
        
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The STEM field was always important to me, and I’ve done well when presented 
                        with challenging aspects within math or science. However, when I realized I 
                        could combine aspects from those topics and my artistic side into computer 
                        science, it was like a switch was flipped inside my brain. It was as if I had 
                        found my purpose. The feeling of creating something from nothing, and 
                        scavenging through the internet for answers to problems that left my mind 
                        completely restless was an incredibly exciting new feeling. Web development, 
                        including both front-end and back-end, has become a strong passion of mine, and I'm 
                        excited to keep learning about various aspects of programming.
